Using the CI /CD pipeline, I ran  a paymeunt application package using Maven’s build lifecycle commands—specifically Compile, Test, Package, and Deploy. First, I forked the repository of a Payment app from GitHub and cloned it into an AWS EC2 instance via the command line using SSH. I then updated the environment using a Linux command, created a new branch for my work, and used Maven Goals to package the application, which was stored in the target directory. Finally, I pushed the updated code back to GitHub. The attached screenshot provides a complete overview of the process. Upon building the package
process i installed Java and Maven application.
